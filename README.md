# ðŸš§ Archived ðŸš§

I decided to remake my portfolio using Hugo instead of React. The theme I chose (as most Hugo themes)
includes blogging capabilities so I decided to move my posts there. This repo will be left public and
running. The index and error pages have been replaced with redirects to 
[here](https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/). 

# Blog

This repository houses my blog created with [Blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)
using the [Papermod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme.

## Running locally

If you want to run the blog locally **without** making changes to the `.Rmd` files you can do so with:

```bash
hugo serve --buildDrafts
```

If you don't have `hugo` installed, check [this](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing).

If you want to edit the `.Rmd` files however you need to use `Blogdown`. Run the following R code:

```R
install.packages('blogdown')
blogdown::serve_site()
```
