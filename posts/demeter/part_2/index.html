I’m not sure if the concept of refresh tokens were there last time but they are there now. The idea is that you have the normal JSON Web Token which expires 10 minutes after you create it (reminder to self to check if I handle timezones properly at some point) but the user also gets a refresh token on login which expires 6 months later, this way whatever client interacts with the app won’t have to ask the user for his credentials since it can just keep using and refreshing the token. The database now also stores Orders and MenuItems. I realized my caching had a small bug where User.PastOrders would not get populated after parsing the results from the cache entry even though the data was in the returned JSON string. This got my stuck for an afternoon. I tried a few different things like adding empty constructors to the User class, adding a constructor that takes the MenuItems as input and annotating it with [JsonConstructor] but none of these worked. Turns out I’d forgotten to add a setter to the MenuItems attribute… I had another bug with the refresh token being considered invalid if the token was expired and it expiring a few minutes off of when it should be but those were more like “code wrong” instead of an elaborate, complicated issue where turns out you just forgot a setter. Most of these were added last time but since I didn’t mention this before; I made a few Powershell scripts for things like starting or watching the app, applying migrations etc. While those do obviously work with the dotnet CLI (which is what the scripts use as well) you had to keep adding the project flag to point the CLI to the correct project which got tedious quite fast and is the only reason why I bothered making these, you’re welcome. I learned about this pretty handy feature of C# which is extension methods. Basically, you create a static method that ends up being used as a method of another class without needing to create a whole different class that inherits from the one you want to add the method to or having to put the class instance inside the method which just looks weird. I used this for having all my Include statements for the User class; because User is a very decently nested class, I have to make a few unions everytime I make a database call and instead of putting the same unions in all my User queries I made an extension method for the User DbSet so that all those unions are in one place. Using it is very easy as instead of doing context.Users I do context.Users.BuildUser.Result where BuildUser is my extension method’s name. As you may notice, it is an async method which is not necessary for this to work but I also use it to calculate and populate some fields that are not mapped to the database such as the price of an order (which is the sum of all the items in that order). This was overall a very useful feature with way too many applications and I was completely unaware of it. I will definitely be finding many uses for it in the future. Not as exciting but finally got around making an endpoint that returns your own user now that authentication works. I just use the user id that I store in the token to make a findOne database query. Lastly, because I also took some time to test most stuff, I realized that the Authentication service was a bit too complicated and hard to test so I decided to move some of the code to a separate “Token” service. Honestly, the biggest perk of testing for me is how it forces you to rethink your code quality. Most of the times I end up doing quite a bit of manual testing before I write my tests and thus I hardly ever actually discover bugs through my testing (which may or may not be a bad thing) but the refactoring I end up doing pretty often is always cool.  The next steps Not entirely sure when I’ll be working on this again (hopefully soon!) but here’s the plan for next time.\n  Extend the cache for the findOne user endpoint and whichever new entities I end up adding\n  I want to look into a few potential refactorings including where the cache logic is at the moment; right not cache lookups happen in the services but I feel like it makes more sense to move those to the repositories since it is still a data access operation and the service should not care about where the data comes from as long as it’s there.\n  I want to look into potential exceptions that I’d want to add. One example of this would be invalid user credentials (empty names or other stuff like that) and just generally things that could go wrong with user input. With this I also want to take a look at my response codes and change them where needed.\n  I think I’ll try to work on items before the next time and I really want to have a paginated output. I’m thinking of having a getAll endpoint that will give you all items from a restaurant but in pages. You should be able to change the page size (with some limitations of course) and select what page number you want returned. A really cool thing to add here would be to have products presorted in the database but I am not sure if\n that is possible or efficient  I will definitely try looking into this though. Adding to this, I’ll start looking into indices since I do want to have the output of this sorted in some way.\n  I still haven’t tested tokenService so there’s that. Some of the stuff in there seemed rather hard to test (at least compared to other stuff I had to test before) which is also why I moved it out of the authentication service.\n  I need to add DTOs. So far, only users have one and it most likely will have to be changed.\n  Closing Thank you for reading once again! The repo can be found here. I am glad that I am still working on this albeit at a pretty slow pace. I often do not have that much energy to spend on this after university work unfortunately but as we say in Greece, “rather slow than never”.

<p>The bulk of the additions since last time concern authentication;</p>
