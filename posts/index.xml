      <description>A simple JWT authorization scheme</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="simple-jwt-authorization-with-net">Simple JWT Authorization with .NET</h1>
<p>Recently I have been working on a side project that needed a very simple toy-like auth
scheme to be implemented. The last few times I implemented JWTs in .NET it was for a full-blown
application which means that I made use of things like <code>IdentityModel</code> and <code>UserManager</code>,
if you want a look at how I made that work you could take a look at the source code of
<a href="https://github.com/AntoniosBarotsis/Demeter">Demeter</a>.</p>
<p>In this case, I did not need <em>Authentication</em>, just <em>Authorization</em>. The two are defined as followed
in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-vs-authorization">MS Docs</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Authentication is the process of proving that you are who you say you are. [&hellip;]
Authorization is the act of granting an authenticated party permission to do something.
It specifies what data you&rsquo;re allowed to access and what you can do with that data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For my use case, simulating a credential check is enough; I don&rsquo;t need to store and check
password salted hashes to make sure a user is indeed who he is supposed to be as this is a toy app
that I am working on with supposedly just one user. All this means that if you are looking for a
tutorial on how to implement Auth for your new project, this is probably not the article for you,
it is just a less verbose way of dealing with JWT generation and validation that works for me.</p>
<p>That being said, let&rsquo;s get started.</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>The only package I used is <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/JWT.Extensions.AspNetCore">JWT.Extensions</a>.
I created 3 classes that make everything work:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>JwtConfig</code>: Holds the JWT secret which is provided in the <code>application.json</code> file. Could also be
used for other pieces of configuration such as the token lifespan</li>
<li><code>Secured</code>: An attribute that when attached to a controller or a specific endpoint requires a
valid token to be provided in the request header</li>
<li><code>TokenService</code>: A very simple interface to the <code>JWT.Extensions</code> API that helps us create and
validate tokens.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-jwtconfig">The <code>JwtConfig</code></h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the config class first. The idea with this is pretty simple; have a section in our
<code>appsettings.json</code> file where we define crucial security information in plain text, what could
possibly go wrong! On a more serious note, while this is fine for developing, you should definitely
use something like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-6.0&amp;tabs=windows">app secrets</a>
or plain old environment variables for this. Once again, my app is not supposed to be secure so I don&rsquo;t
care.</p>
<p>The class itself is pretty simple in my case:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> record JwtConfig(<span style="color:#66d9ef">string</span> Secret = <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;fallback-secret&#34;</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>And here&rsquo;s my settings file</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json">{
  <span style="color:#f92672">&#34;JwtConfig&#34;</span>: {
    <span style="color:#f92672">&#34;secret&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;jwt-secret&#34;</span>
  },
  <span style="color:#f92672">&#34;Logging&#34;</span>: {
    <span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">...</span>
  },
  <span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">...</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>Now that that&rsquo;s out of the way, let&rsquo;s make sure we use the secret from our settings file in the
<code>JwtConfig</code> instances.</p>
<p>I made it so the class is registered as a singleton in the DI container, the binding itself is
pretty simple:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="color:#75715e">// Program.cs
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> jwtConfig = <span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> JwtConfig();
builder.Configuration.Bind(nameof(jwtConfig), jwtConfig);
builder.Services.AddSingleton(jwtConfig);
</code></pre></div><p>I used <code>nameof</code> just because I wanted to be sure that the config file&rsquo;s section is titled the
exact same as the class itself to avoid confusion, this is just a string so swapping it out for
<code>&quot;JwtConfig&quot;</code> would change nothing.</p>
<p>Since we are here, let&rsquo;s also configure some basic settings for our tokens</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="color:#75715e">// Program.cs
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>builder.Services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
    {
        options.DefaultChallengeScheme = JwtAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
        options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = JwtAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    })
    .AddJwt(options =&gt; { options.Keys = <span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span>[] { jwtConfig.Secret }; });

builder.Services.AddSingleton&lt;IAlgorithmFactory&gt;(<span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> HMACSHAAlgorithmFactory());
</code></pre></div><p>This is taken straight from their <a href="https://github.com/jwt-dotnet/jwt#register-authentication-handler-to-validate-jwt">documentation</a>
so I won&rsquo;t be explaining it too much, just know that we are telling the package to use
the key we just defined and we are also using the <code>HMACSHA</code> algorithm.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this throws us a warning as this is no longer considered secure
and it is recommended to &ldquo;consider switching to RSASSA or ECDSA&rdquo;. Once again, for the purposes
of my use case, this is not a concern.</p>
<h2 id="the-tokenservice">The <code>TokenService</code></h2>
<p>This is where most of the interesting stuff happens. Let&rsquo;s first create the class, get our
<code>jwtConfig</code> secret and assign it to a <code>JwtBuilder</code> instance which we&rsquo;ll use later.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">TokenService</span>
{
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">private</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">readonly</span> JwtBuilder <span style="color:#ae81ff">_</span>jwtBuilder;

    <span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> TokenService(JwtConfig jwtConfig)
    {
        <span style="color:#ae81ff">_</span>jwtBuilder = JwtBuilder.Create()
            .WithAlgorithm(<span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> HMACSHA512Algorithm())
            .WithSecret(jwtConfig.Secret);
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Creating the token itself is also pretty much copy-pasted from their
<a href="https://github.com/jwt-dotnet/jwt#register-authentication-handler-to-validate-jwt">docs</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">string</span> Create(<span style="color:#66d9ef">string</span> username)
{
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">_</span>jwtBuilder
        .AddClaim(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;exp&#34;</span>, DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddHours(<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>).ToUnixTimeSeconds())
        .AddClaim(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;username&#34;</span>, username)
        .Encode();
}
</code></pre></div><p>I only use the expiration date and username for claims.</p>
<p>Lastly, verification.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">bool</span> Verify(<span style="color:#66d9ef">string</span> token)
{
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">try</span>
    {
        <span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> json = <span style="color:#ae81ff">_</span>jwtBuilder
            .MustVerifySignature()
            .Decode(token);

        <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> json <span style="color:#66d9ef">is</span> not <span style="color:#66d9ef">null</span>;
    }
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">catch</span> (Exception)
    {
        <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">false</span>;
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>I only need a true or false return as I don&rsquo;t care why the token was not valid. In case the token is a
valid JWT but it is expired, <code>json</code> will be null. If on the other hand, the signature is invalid,
then an exception will be thrown for whatever reason.</p>
<h2 id="the-secured-attribute">The <code>Secured</code> Attribute</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, all this is glued together by the use of attributes. For this to work,
we need to implement the <code>IAuthorizationFilter</code> interface. This will make it so our code will be
executed to determine whether a request should be authorized or not.</p>
<p>The code for this is also simple but let&rsquo;s go over it step by step</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="color:#a6e22e">[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class | AttributeTargets.Method)]</span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">Secured</span> : Attribute, IAuthorizationFilter
{
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> OnAuthorization(AuthorizationFilterContext context)
    {
        <span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> jwtConfig = context.HttpContext.RequestServices.GetService&lt;JwtConfig&gt;();
        <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> (jwtConfig == <span style="color:#66d9ef">null</span>) <span style="color:#66d9ef">throw</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> ArgumentNullException();

        <span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> tokenService = <span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> TokenService(jwtConfig);
        <span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> token = context
            .HttpContext
            .Request
            .Headers[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Authorization&#34;</span>]
            .ToString()
            .Replace(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Bearer &#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;&#34;</span>);

        <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> (!tokenService.Verify(token))
            context.Result = <span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> JsonResult(<span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> { message = <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Unauthorized&#34;</span> })
                { StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status401Unauthorized };
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>As I mentioned earlier, I want this to apply to both endpoints and entire controllers, hence
the first line. In order to implement <code>IAuthorizationFilter</code>, we need to define the <code>OnAuthorization</code>
method. We use the <code>IServiceProdiver</code> to retrieve our <code>JwtConfig</code> instance and make sure it is not null.
We then instantiate <code>TokenService</code> and retrieve the token from the request header. Finally, we make sure
to throw an Unauthorized message to the user if the token is invalid, otherwise, the request pipeline
will proceed as expected.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it! We can now add our newly created attribute to whichever controller or endpoint we want
and it will be locked behind a valid JWT requirement.</p>
<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
<p>This pretty much concludes the article! As I mentioned earlier, this is a very specific and lacking
implementation, the main point of the article was to showcase how you could use your own attributes
to simplify the process which to me feels simpler (and less verbose) compared to some of my previous
implementations.</p>
<p>This is probably the most boring article I&rsquo;ve written so far but I promise you that the project I am
going to use this for is interesting. It&rsquo;s also a lot harder than anything I&rsquo;ve tried before so don&rsquo;t
expect that the be out anytime soon.</p>
<p>Till next time :)</p>

      <description>My attempt at a testing framework</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="what-is-veritas">What is Veritas</h1>
<p>Veritas is a small testing framework that I am building for <a href="https://github.com/pijuskri/Po-Sharp">a friend&rsquo;s compiler</a>. He started
working on this project recently and seeing as how I found it very interesting, I decided to contribute to it. I then remembered that
I do not know how to build compilers so I instead decided to finally look into things like reflection and frameworks and decided
to build one for his language.</p>
<p>All cool projects have 2 things in common: a pipeline badge and a mythological name, so I made a pipeline and found out that the Romans
had a goddess of truth called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veritas">Veritas</a>, somehow the Romans did not have a goddess of Unit
Testing Frameworks so I unfortunately had to go with that.</p>
<h1 id="what-does-it-do">What does it do</h1>
<p>The fact that building a framework that is written in one language and tests another one is complicated should not be a surprise.</p>
<p>I essentially had to come up with a way of representing Po# code (that&rsquo;s what my friend called the language) as well as compiling,
executing it and validating its output. I also wanted to make working with it not too different from commonly used frameworks as in
I wanted everything to work through annotations, the tester should not have to worry about what was happening behind the scenes for the
tests to work.</p>
<h1 id="but-what-does-using-veritas-look-like">But what does using Veritas look like?</h1>
<p>I am glad you asked! Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span style="color:#a6e22e">@Test</span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">TestExample</span> <span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> valTest1<span style="color:#f92672">()</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">:</span> <span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">Boolean</span><span style="color:#f92672">,</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">String</span><span style="color:#f92672">)</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">=</span>
    <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;&#34;&#34;def main(): int {
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">         val a = 5;
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">         print(a);
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">         return 0;
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">       }&#34;&#34;&#34;</span>
      <span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">ShouldBe</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;5&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">)</span>
      <span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">Run</span><span style="color:#f92672">()</span>
<span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>If the code seems weird to you then worry not for there are <a href="https://github.com/pijuskri/Po-Sharp/blob/master/docs/Guide.md">docs</a> about it.</p>
<p>I am not sure if this is a common thing under other languages or maybe under a different name but I have been doing a lot of C# lately
and there is this concept of &ldquo;fluent&rdquo; syntax which essentially is code that is very intuitive and easy to read, almost like reading plain
English. I was heavily inspired by <a href="https://fluentassertions.com/introduction">Fluent Assertions</a> and I want to add/change some stuff on the
Veritas interface to make it a little more like it as I really like using it, I believe you can already see that it heavily inspired
Veritas' design.</p>
<p>At this point, you might have noticed the interesting return type, a boolean string tuple? The boolean indicates whether the test passed or
failed while the string holds a message useful for debugging (so if a test fails, it can show the difference between expected and actual
value). I believe that because of how my test invocation works I cannot get the return value of the code directly, hence this ugly tuple,
it&rsquo;s been some time since I &ldquo;designed&rdquo; this.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, runtime exceptions aren&rsquo;t fully implemented into the language yet but when it comes to compiler exceptions you
can do the following.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> parseErrorTest<span style="color:#f92672">()</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">:</span> <span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">Boolean</span><span style="color:#f92672">,</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">String</span><span style="color:#f92672">)</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">=</span>
  <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;{def a; a = 5; print(a);}&#34;</span>
    <span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">ShouldThrow</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">ParseException</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">))</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Something similar will be added for runtime exceptions with possibly a <code>.WithMessage</code> option to verify that the code crashed with the
appropriate message but that will depend on how concise those messages end up being. The compiler error messages are a bit too
dev-debug friendly rather than language-user friendly for the time being so <code>.WithMessage</code> does not make sense for compile-time errors,
they essentially look like a small stack trace.</p>
<p>Another thing that is perhaps worth mentioning is the use of extension methods. Extension methods, in essence, add methods to a class from
outside of this class. That sounds terribly boring until you realize how useful it is in some scenarios, in this case, it just looks a
bit cleaner. Using extension methods I could ditch the old syntax of the tests that looked like this</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> parseErrorTest<span style="color:#f92672">()</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">:</span> <span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">Boolean</span><span style="color:#f92672">,</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">String</span><span style="color:#f92672">)</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">=</span>

</code></pre></div><p>and instead go away with the class instantiation. I attached a few methods to the Scala String class which in turn call <code>PoSharpScript</code>
under the hood.</p>
<p>Scala implements extension methods through <em>implicit</em> classes;</p>

</code></pre></div><p><code>IPoSharp</code> is a trait (or interface) that defines the 2 methods you can see below and <code>PoSharpScript</code> is the main class I use to interact
with Po# code. I made use of this recently as a wrapper to the <code>PoSharpScript</code> class since the logic was already implemented there,
this is purely for syntactic sugar.</p>
<h1 id="running-the-test-code">Running the test code</h1>
<p>This part is a little messy. Compiling and writing the assembly code to a file is easy since there are methods for this
in the main package of the compiler but I also have to run it somehow. In case you haven&rsquo;t checked out the repo, you need WSL to run
the code, you cannot run some of the tools natively on windows. Thankfully, Scala has this <a href="https://scala-lang.org/api/3.1.1/scala/sys/process.html">Process</a>
class that can help with that. I can use that class to spawn an external process that launches WSL and runs MAKE</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span style="color:#66d9ef">import</span> scala.sys.process.Process

<span style="color:#a6e22e">Process</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#e6db74">s&#34;wsl make TARGET_FILE=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">$fileName</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">).!!</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This snippet returns anything that would normally get printed to the terminal if we were to run this command. <code>TARGET_FILE</code> is a variable
used in the makefile to specify the <code>.asm</code> file as well as the executable.</p>
<h1 id="how-and-why-did-i-make-use-of-multi-threading">How and why did I make use of multi-threading</h1>
<p>The way the compiler works is: it gets fed some input in Po# from either a <code>.txt</code> file or in this case just a string, that gets parsed
and compiled to <a href="https://nasm.org/">NASM</a> which gets dumped to a <code>.asm</code> file which we can now finally execute. That&rsquo;s cool but how can
we actually get the test output then? Well, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a good solution to this, or at least not one that I could come up with.
What I settled for is reading the last thing that the code prints which of course requires the snippet to print something. As of now,
runtime exceptions have not been fully added yet but when that happens, the same would apply for getting the exception message and I could
additionally check the exit code.</p>
<p>Executing the test snippets is terribly slow because of all the file accesses + compilation required + spawning the external WSL process.
At the time of writing this, 7 tests executed sequentially take 5-6 seconds, this will only get worse with more tests. Since there are only
so many tests as of now we can afford to assign one test per thread (which seems to be the most efficient for the time being), that takes the
execution time down to around a second or two, this will hopefully scale much better than the sequential solution.</p>
<p>Since a <code>.asm</code> file gets created for each test I need to make sure that they have unique names so the different threads don&rsquo;t cause issues.
I decided to set the file name to <code>packageName.className.methodName</code> which should be unique at all times. These are also cleared after
all tests are finished executing so no artifacts are left behind.</p>
<p>I tried to think a bit ahead here and try to find out what would be a good future-proof optimization to make. Up until this point,
spawning one thread per test is the most efficient way of running the tests which if you&rsquo;ve done multi-threading may sound overkill
and or counterintuitive but again, the process of running a test is very slow. But since it&rsquo;s probably not a good idea to allocate
threads in this way for 1000 tests I decided to allow for chunking the test methods per thread which should be the best of both worlds;
it is not fully sequential so we have a performance boost but it also scales better since each thread will be handling more than one
test at a time. This should in theory be faster in the future when more tests get added compared to having a set amount of available
threads with one test each and having to wait for them to finish running before you allocate another one for the next test. Since it is
still early and I can&rsquo;t know what the optimal amount of threads or number of chunks is both are variables.</p>
<h1 id="detecting-test-methods-and-invoking-them">Detecting test methods and invoking them</h1>
<p>I settled with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>All test classes must be in the <code>test</code> package</li>
<li>All test methods must be defined inside of a class annotated with <code>@Test</code></li>
<li>All test methods must include the keyword <code>test</code> in their name</li>
</ul>
<p>I kind of combined what <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/">JUnit</a> and <a href="https://pytest.org/">PyTest</a> do with the <code>@Test</code> and method names (although
I think PyTest does it with filenames instead of method names). I could&rsquo;ve made it so you need the methods annotated instead but decided to
go for this instead for no particular reason other than it will look a bit less cluttered. Since I consider tests to have <code>test</code> in their
method name one can also easily define helper methods in the class and they won&rsquo;t be treated as tests.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://github.com/ronmamo/reflections">this</a> a great library that allows you to easily use reflection.</p>
<p>I first need to get all classes inside the <code>test</code> package which I achieve with the following:</p>

<h1 id="creating-the-pipeline">Creating the pipeline</h1>
<p>Building the pipeline was more complicated than it sounds. For starters, the project initially used <a href="https://www.scala-sbt.org/">SBT</a>.
When I was developing the framework I would test run it using Intellij which would compile everything with Java behind the scenes unlike
SBT which uses Scala. Turns out the 2 have some runtime differences when it comes to the classloaders and the test classes could not
be detected so I eventually made a merge request that made everything work through Gradle which took a bit of fiddling around until
everything started working again but at least the classloaders were not complaining anymore.</p>
<p>Another issue I had was getting the pipeline to work on an Ubuntu image which seemed to also have some classloader issues
because the test methods could not get invoked. In case anyone is willing to take a look and potentially fix it, here&rsquo;s the
<a href="https://github.com/AntoniosBarotsis/Po-Sharp/runs/5428580842?check_suite_focus=true">pipeline run</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/AntoniosBarotsis/Po-Sharp/blob/152fbbdeb5b570024a4210e2563f3295459ef9cf/.github/workflows/workflow.yml">pipeline yml file</a>.</p>
<p>Other than that small hiccup, the rest was fairly standard stuff.</p>
<p>I want the pipeline to run on master pushes and on pull requests. The job should run on a windows image, I checkout to the repo and use
<a href="https://github.com/Vampire/setup-wsl">this</a> action to set up WSL, Gradle has a short post about setting up a Gradle build workflow
<a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/gradle-build-action">here</a> which I used for the setup and finally I install any WSL
dependencies I need and run the Gradle task for the tests</p>

<h1 id="the-future">The future</h1>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, the framework is not done which is to be expected since the language itself is not done evolving. Now that the
the pipeline is also complete I have reached a point where the framework is both capable enough to test anything currently present in the
language and can ensure that nothing breaks over time through the pipeline.</p>
<p>That being said, I now have the freedom to worry about more &ldquo;trivial&rdquo; things such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Actual error handling that does not simply wrap the entire framework in a try-catch</li>
<li>Improved error messages for anything that could go wrong</li>
<li><del><em>Steal</em></del> get inspiration from Fluent Assertions on new things to add</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this is what I can come up with now, more stuff will probably appear along the way as the language evolves.</p>
<h1 id="closing">Closing</h1>
<p>All in all, it has been really cool and interesting to work on this. It was really interesting to dive into reflection, it really
is fascinating to me how you can interact with a project&rsquo;s source code through &hellip; more source code. It also gives you a better
understanding of how these frameworks function which is great. Multi-threading was another thing I enjoyed getting into, I recently
developed an interest to parallel programming and this is one of the ways I pursued that interest. It&rsquo;s nice knowing your code
helps someone and makes their lives easier but also more boring because who likes writing tests am I right?</p>
<p>Really interested in seeing where this will go from now, till next time!</p>

      <description>How I published a CLI tool in Chocolatey and Nuget.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- fix the date! -->
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>I recently started working on a command line tool that uses git hooks to remind you to run your
tests and builds before pushing your code among other stuff and I decided to package that and
publish it so anyone could use it. The project itself is nothing too impressive or innovative
so in this post I will be mostly focusing on the packaging and publication process rather than
the project itself but in case you are interested in checking it out, click
<a href="https://github.com/AntoniosBarotsis/Rember">here</a> and go make some issues :)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be explaining how I published said package and how to make a Github Actions CD workflow
to publish your new releases automatically.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>I feel like most if not all developers find the idea of making their work available for anyone
to check out and use an exciting one and I definitely relate to that. I personally really like
working on things that can be used by other developers specifically and that&rsquo;s the main reasons
why I started this project and why I decided to make it easily accessible to anyone (unless
you are not on windows because I was too lazy to check how that would work).</p>
<p>I decided early on that I wanted to publish my code on 2 platforms; the package manager of my
language of choice (in this case, NuGet) and a more general purpose package manager like
<a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> so that my audience would not be limited to developers
from my tech stack only.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-i-build-exactly">What did I build exactly</h2>
<p>The project was built using C# mostly because of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNDgcBDZPkU">this</a>
video I came across (great YouTuber by the way, make sure to check his channel out for C# content). TLDR; C#
has this thing called <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools">dotnet tools</a> which
are essentially command line applications that are very easy to make and package. The linked video walks you
through creating one from scratch.</p>
<h1 id="uploading-to-nuget">Uploading to NuGet</h1>
<h2 id="preparing">Preparing</h2>
<p>Once you have your CLI tool up and running there&rsquo;s only that many steps left to push it to NuGet.</p>
<p>The mentioned video already guides you through adding most of the stuff that you need in your <code>.csproj</code>
file but here&rsquo;s a few more things you might want to add:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A README file</p>
<p>If you want your NuGet package to display the README file you spent hours filling with meaningless
badges, this is for you. All you have to do is add the following:</p>

<p>Other useful tags might include <code>RepositoryUrl</code> to link your Github repo and <code>PackageTags</code>
to provide a list of space-delimited tags for your package.</p>

<p>I do also recommend specifying the <code>RuntimeIdentifier</code> to something like <code>win-x64</code> although from
what I understand this is not necessary but better safe than sorry!</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="pushing-the-package">Pushing the Package</h2>
<p>That pretty much concludes the needed preparations for NuGet so time to actually push the thing.</p>
<p>Run <code>dotnet pack</code> and you should get something along the lines of <code>Successfully created package 'path/to/package.nupkg'</code>.</p>
<p>Next you want to grab yourself a NuGet API Key from <a href="https://www.nuget.org/account/apikeys">here</a>
and run the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">dotnet nuget push path/to/package.nupkg <span style="color:#ae81ff">\
</span><span style="color:#ae81ff"></span>  --api-key &lt;API_KEY&gt; <span style="color:#ae81ff">\
</span><span style="color:#ae81ff"></span>  --source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json
</code></pre></div><p>If all goes well your package will be soon available on NuGet! Wasn&rsquo;t that simple?</p>
<h1 id="uploading-to-chocolatey">Uploading to Chocolatey</h1>
<h2 id="preparing-1">Preparing</h2>
<p>Chocolatey requires you to provide a so called <code>nuspec</code> file which essentially provides some details
for your package. I personally found their <a href="https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/create-packages#nuspec">docs</a>
a bit confusing so if you get confused perhaps looking over at my repository could help you out more after you&rsquo;ve
read through them.</p>
<p>You will see that most of the stuff we specify are essentially the same as what we specified earlier for NuGet.
Only thing to note here is that you want to make sure that everything your package needs ends up in the <code>tools</code>
folder.</p>
<h2 id="compiling">Compiling</h2>
<p>Uploading to Choco is a little more complicated. First of all, we need to compile our code to a single
file that has everything it needs to run bundled inside of it aka, a self contained file. It is also a
good idea to try and remove anything that is not used in terms of libraries considering how much larger
this file is going to be compared to the <code>nupkg</code> file we created earlier. Take a look at the docs for
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish">dotnet publish</a> but TLDR; our command
will look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">dotnet publish -o tools <span style="color:#ae81ff">\
</span><span style="color:#ae81ff"></span>  --self-contained True <span style="color:#ae81ff">\
</span><span style="color:#ae81ff"></span>  /property:PublishTrimmed<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>True <span style="color:#ae81ff">\
</span><span style="color:#ae81ff"></span>  /property:PublishSingleFile<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>True
</code></pre></div><p>The reason why I specify these properties in the arguments of the command instead of in the <code>csproj</code>
file is because I would have to keep toggling them on and off depending on whether I was
targetting NuGet or Choco.</p>
<p>I also specify the following in the <code>csproj</code> file to hopefully cut the executable file size down a
bit more:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span style="color:#f92672">&lt;DebugType&gt;</span>none<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/DebugType&gt;</span>
<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;DebugSymbols&gt;</span>false<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/DebugSymbols&gt;</span>
<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;Configuration&gt;</span>release<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/Configuration&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This should create a <code>.exe</code> file in the <code>tools</code> folder.</p>
<h2 id="pushing-to-chocolatey">Pushing to Chocolatey</h2>
<p>We are almost done! We now only need to run the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">choco pack
choco push --api-key<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>&lt;API KEY&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Your API key can be found <a href="https://community.chocolatey.org/account">here</a> and I do not know why
navigating to your profile page is so hard on their website.</p>
<p>Publications on Chocolatey take way longer than NuGet (around 1-3 hours from personal experience)
so sit back, go grab yourself some coffee, do some laundry, watch some YouTube, call your friends,
finish that one side project you abandoned 7 months ago, and check your email every 2 minutes in
case something goes wrong with the publication.</p>
<h1 id="time-to-make-a-workflow">Time to make a Workflow</h1>
<p>Workflows are great! They do the boring, repetitive stuff for you automatically so you don&rsquo;t have
to worry about forgetting them or doing something wrong, your project looks cooler and more serious
with them but most importantly, from what I understand, they qualify you for DevOps positions which
pay quite well so that&rsquo;s the main reason why you should care about making them 👍</p>
<p>Feel free to check <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#release">Github&rsquo;s docs</a>.</p>
<p>We first start by specifying that we want our workflow to run on a new release publication</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml"><span style="color:#f92672">on</span>:

    <span style="color:#f92672">types</span>: [<span style="color:#ae81ff">published]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The release event has a bunch of different types that are explained very nicely in the documentation,
I personally chose <code>published</code> which gets triggered for normal as well as pre-releases.</p>
<p>The good news is that this is a very simply workflow because we&rsquo;ve already figured out how to do most
of the work from our terminals!</p>

in your github repository and create your first release!</p>
<h1 id="closing">Closing</h1>
<p>Overall, I feel like this was a little less exciting than some of my other posts but to me, the whole process
of publishing this project was quite exciting and I wanted to write something about it. Hopefully this inspires
someone to go make his own package or library and make it available, same way Nick&rsquo;s video inspired me to work
on this project. Till next time!</p>

      <description>The early stages</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been sometime since my last post but I just now got to work on the project again.</p>
<h1 id="progress-since-last-time">Progress since last time</h1>
<p>The bulk of the additions since last time concern authentication;</p>
<ul>
<li>Added <code>Login</code> and <code>Refresh</code> endpoints. I&rsquo;m not sure if the concept of refresh tokens were there
last time but they are there now. The idea is that you have the normal JSON Web Token which
expires 10 minutes after you create it (reminder to self to check if I handle timezones properly
at some point) but the user also gets a refresh token on login which expires 6 months later,
this way whatever client interacts with the app won&rsquo;t have to ask the user for his credentials
since it can just keep using and refreshing the token.</li>
<li>The database now also stores <code>Orders</code> and <code>MenuItems</code>.</li>
<li>I realized my caching had a small bug where <code>User.PastOrders</code> would not get populated after
parsing the results from the cache entry even though the data was in the returned JSON string.
This got my stuck for an afternoon. I tried a few different things like adding empty
constructors to the <code>User</code> class,  adding a constructor that takes the <code>MenuItems</code> as input and
annotating it with <code>[JsonConstructor]</code> but none of these worked. Turns out I&rsquo;d forgotten to add
a setter to the <code>MenuItems</code> attribute&hellip; I had another bug with the refresh token being
considered invalid if the token was expired and it expiring a few minutes off of when it should
be but those were more like &ldquo;code wrong&rdquo; instead of an elaborate, complicated issue where turns
out you just forgot a setter.</li>
<li>Most of these were added last time but since I didn&rsquo;t mention this before; I made a few
Powershell scripts for things like starting or watching the app, applying migrations etc.
While those do obviously work with the <code>dotnet</code> CLI (which is what the scripts use as well)
you had to keep adding the <code>project</code> flag to point the CLI to the correct project which got
tedious quite fast and is the only reason why I bothered making these, you&rsquo;re welcome.</li>
<li>I learned about this pretty handy feature of C# which is extension methods. Basically,
you create a static method that ends up being used as a method of another class without
needing to create a whole different class that inherits from the one you want to add the method
to or having to put the class instance inside the method which just looks weird. I used this
for having all my <code>Include</code> statements for the <code>User</code> class; because <code>User</code> is a very decently
nested class, I have to make a few unions everytime I make a database call and instead of
putting the same unions in all my <code>User</code> queries I made an extension method for the <code>User</code>
<code>DbSet</code> so that all those unions are in one place. Using it is very easy as instead of
doing <code>context.Users</code> I do <code>context.Users.BuildUser.Result</code> where <code>BuildUser</code> is my extension
method&rsquo;s name. As you may notice, it is an async method which is not necessary for this to work
but I also use it to calculate and populate some fields that are not mapped to the database such
as the price of an order (which is the sum of all the items in that order). This was overall a
very useful feature with way too many applications and I was completely unaware of it. I will
definitely be finding many uses for it in the future.</li>
<li>Not as exciting but finally got around making an endpoint that returns your own user now that
authentication works. I just use the user id that I store in the token to make a <code>findOne</code>
database query.</li>
<li>Lastly, because I also took some time to test <em>most</em> stuff, I realized that the Authentication
service was a bit too complicated and hard to test so I decided to move some of the code to a
separate &ldquo;Token&rdquo; service. Honestly, the biggest perk of testing for me is how it forces you
to rethink your code quality. Most of the times I end up doing quite a bit of manual testing
before I write my tests and thus I hardly ever actually discover bugs through my testing
(which may or may not be a bad thing) but the refactoring I end up doing pretty often is always
cool.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-next-steps">The next steps</h1>
<p>Not entirely sure when I&rsquo;ll be working on this again (hopefully soon!) but here&rsquo;s the plan for next
time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extend the cache for the <code>findOne</code> user endpoint and whichever new entities I end up adding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to look into a few potential refactorings including where the cache logic is at the
moment; right not cache lookups happen in the services but I feel like it makes more sense to
move those to the repositories since it is still a data access operation and the service should
not care about where the data comes from as long as it&rsquo;s there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to look into potential exceptions that I&rsquo;d want to add. One example of this would be
invalid user credentials (empty names or other stuff like that) and just generally things
that could go wrong with user input. With this I also want to take a look at my response codes
and change them where needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll try to work on items before the next time and I really want to have a paginated
output. I&rsquo;m thinking of having a <code>getAll</code> endpoint that will give you all items from a restaurant
but in pages. You should be able to change the page size (with some limitations of course) and
select what page number you want returned. A really cool thing to add here would be to have
products presorted in the database but I am not sure if</p>
<ul>
<li>that is possible</li>
<li>or efficient</li>
</ul>
<p>I will definitely try looking into this though. Adding to this, I&rsquo;ll start looking into indices
since I do want to have the output of this sorted in some way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I still haven&rsquo;t tested <code>tokenService</code> so there&rsquo;s that. Some of the stuff in there seemed rather
hard to test (at least compared to other stuff I had to test before) <em>which is also why I moved
it out of the authentication service</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need to add DTOs. So far, only users have one and it most likely will have to be changed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="closing">Closing</h1>
<p>Thank you for reading once again! The repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/AntoniosBarotsis/Demeter">here</a>.
I am glad that I am still working on this albeit at a pretty slow pace. I often do not have that
much energy to spend on this after university work unfortunately but as we say in Greece,
&ldquo;rather slow than never&rdquo;. Till next time.</p>

      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 16:37:08 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>The early stages</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="progress-since-last-time">Progress since last time</h1>
<p>When I made the first blog post, I basically just had an empty project with not much code in it. At the time of writing this, I still don&rsquo;t have an insane
amount of progress done but there&rsquo;s definitely a lot more things going on.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some of the &ldquo;big&rdquo; stuff that have been added:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added a PSQL database container</p>
<p>I decided to use a Postgres database because of the <a href="https://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a> plugin which will allow me to work with geolocation data later on.
Right now, there&rsquo;s not a whole lot going on in the database; I&rsquo;ve only added the <code>User</code> and <code>Order</code> fields because I wanted to implement authentication.
The next model that should get added soon will probably be the <code>Owner</code> and after that I think I&rsquo;ll rethink the rest of my models and eventually add those
all together. I also created a class that applies any pending migrations to the database and clears + seeds it every time the server runs. The latter
will of course not be around when the app is complete but for now it is very handy for manual testing. You can find the class
<a href="https://github.com/AntoniosBarotsis/Demeter/blob/master/src/Infrastructure/Data/DatabaseSeeder.cs">here</a> if you want to see how that works but in
essence it is nothing more than one hard coded user with one past order with no items (did not want to also add items this soon for testing).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a Redis database container</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking of using a cache for a while in my project but was limited by the fact that I couldn&rsquo;t run more than one container when hosting
my apps as stated earlier so was pretty excited for this to say the least. I came up with a weird (perhaps overcomplicated way) of setting the
key values using enums, idea being that I don&rsquo;t randomly make a small typo and end up getting cache misses when I shouldn&rsquo;t be. The general cache service
can be found <a href="https://github.com/AntoniosBarotsis/Demeter/blob/master/src/Infrastructure/Data/Redis/RedisCacheService.cs">here</a> and an example usage
for users is <a href="https://github.com/AntoniosBarotsis/Demeter/blob/master/src/Domain/Services/UserService.cs">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Used a bunch of libraries that I&rsquo;ve wanted to glue together for some time, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automapper</li>
<li>MediatR with CQRS</li>
<li>Serilog</li>
</ul>
<p>Automapper is extremely useful and will definitely be using it in probably all my future projects. In my last &ldquo;big&rdquo; project which was Gromceri
(<em>haven&rsquo;t talked much about it and have also not finished + kind of abandoned but might get back to that at some point, you can read some stuff
about it <a href="https://twitter.com/gromceri">here</a></em>) I was using function expressions which had the advantage of being chainable with my LINQ queries
(and thus looking cool) but looking back, that was not such a clean looking solution and I also do not think that it was that great of an idea to
convert entities to their DTOs right after a query.</p>
<p>MediatR and CQRS are both pretty cool and I can kind of see why they would be useful in very big, complicated projects but I feel like they are
way too verbose for a one man project. However, that being said they do help keep the overall flow cleaner by separating the layers which is why
I will rethink whether I want to stick to MediatR at the end of this project&rsquo;s development when I&rsquo;ll have a better idea of it.</p>
<p>Yes I&rsquo;ve been wanted to use loggers properly in an actual project for some time. This will definitely get more interesting once I add Elasticsearch
and Kibana to the project but even now it is cool. I also want to add error handling middleware which will definitely leverage the logger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally did some proper testing!</p>
<p>If you visit the project you&rsquo;ll see that I&rsquo;ve added Codecov to it to force myself to test more. At the moment I have only been testing my Domain
which is where the models and their Services live and I&rsquo;m not sure if I will also test my other 2 layers.</p>
<p>One thing that I want to admit is that testing definitely forces you to write cleaner code. I really appreciate dependency injection and an overall
separation of functionality a lot more after having sank quite some time into testing my code.</p>
<p>A few very helpful libraries I used for my tests are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://autofixture.github.io/">Autofixture</a></p>
<p>This is such a great tool and I wish I learnt about it earlier. TLDR: It is used to instantiate your classes with random data. The great thing about it
is that, well, you don&rsquo;t have to type everything out yourself which except for being time saving, saves you the errors when your classes change
and can also help in discovering errors with your logic given specific input (since it is random).</p>
<p>What I really like about it is that you can also control the values of specific attributes while everything else is random. For example, one thing
I did in some of my tests is have a predefined order price and I wanted the menu items themselves to have random data but that given price, this is
very easy to do with this package!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://nsubstitute.github.io/">NSubstitute</a></p>
<p>NSubstitute is used for mocking, that&rsquo;s it. It has a very clean syntax that really works for me and it just works. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be switching that
for a different mocking library any time soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://fluentassertions.com/introduction">FluentAssertions</a></p>
<p>Similarly, Fluent Assertions have a very neat syntax for assertions that just works nicely. Also coming from Java&rsquo;s JUnit, testing for exceptions
finally has syntax you can memorize.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added JWT Role based authentication</p>
<p>It is not the first time I implemented JWT in a project but was very glad that it took me about an hour instead of a few weeks like last time.
I borrowed much of the configuration for stuff like password strength and what not from that previous implementation but reworked both the classes
associated with authentication themselves and their position in the project. I also feel like I added enough self explanatory exception messages
for when stuff fails. I also added roles to the authentication scheme (which I think work but I haven&rsquo;t added owners yet so can&rsquo;t be certain).
This was a lot easier than I thought it was gonna be. The only interesting thing about this is that I used an enum for the role which I found out how to
store as a string to the database (and in the response DTO) instead of an int.</p>
<p>Something that wasn&rsquo;t great was how the <code>userManager</code> class from the Identity package does not have a relevant interface which meant I couldn&rsquo;t really
test it so I instead made my own interface with the methods that I am going to need and made the implementation use an instance of <code>userManager</code> which
has the same effect but makes it testable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Something that doesn&rsquo;t really fit anywhere else is that I did a bit more research on RabbitMQ and found out that what I probably want to use is the RPC
functionality it offers which <em>I think</em> will require another project running. If that is the case I will probably make a very simple, one endpoint
separate API project that I can run from the docker compose file. Since I don&rsquo;t actually want to do something more with it other than make it wait for a bit
as if it is processing the payment or whatever and then return &ldquo;payment successful&rdquo; this should work fine. I am not entire sure how this will work yet
(does the code wait for the remote call to be completed or does it receive a notification?) but that should be one of the very last things that I will add
to the project so it is not really something to worry about at the moment.</p>
<h1 id="the-next-steps">The next steps</h1>
<p>I believe that I will be toning down the amount of work that I put into the project for a little while because of some irl issues and university + work
being a thing. I also don&rsquo;t have an exact plan of what to do next but here&rsquo;s some of the stuff that I will work on for the next post</p>
<ul>
<li>Add more models to the database</li>
<li>Use redis for most if not all endpoints</li>
<li>Add a refresh token for the JWT</li>
<li>Make a <code>login</code> and <code>refresh</code> endpoint</li>
<li>Have a user endpoint that returns data only for the user making the request</li>
<li>Add Elasticsearch and Kibana (?)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="closing">Closing</h1>
<p>As always, thanks for reading! The repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/AntoniosBarotsis/Demeter">here</a>. I am really proud of the progress of the project
so far and I am just hoping that I can get back to being productive on it after I deal with everything else going on in my life right now</p>

      <description>The beginning of my new project.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="what-is-project-demeter">What is Project Demeter</h1>
<p>This is my latest passion past-time toy project that I will be working on for some time. You can read some details about it
<a href="https://github.com/AntoniosBarotsis/Demeter">here</a> but long story short: it will be a food ordering service minus the payment bit.</p>
<p>And since I posted the repository, I should note that I have already changed my mind for some of the stuff mentioned there
(mainly that I will be using Postgres instead of SQLite and that I will definitely use RabbitMQ) so don&rsquo;t take everything I said
there word for word as this is still pretty early in development.</p>
<h1 id="why">Why</h1>
<p>I think it will be a great learning experience for me (if I actually push myself to finish it).</p>
<p>There are so many things that I want to make use of and it feels pretty overwhelming at the moment but I&rsquo;m sure that will improve
once I start actually working on it. So far the only thing that I have figured out is how to use <a href="https://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a>
(which is a Postgres plugin that allows you to work with spatial data) to make queries about stuff&rsquo;s locations.</p>
<h1 id="my-progress">My Progress</h1>
<p>I figured that would be a good starting point considering that one of the main features I want this service to have is making radial distance
queries around your location for near by restaurants. The SQL itself is not hard, I just have to figure out how to convert that to something EF Core
understands and am set for that. Other than that, the only thing that I have at the moment is a basic project structure with no actual code in it.
I will be probably working on figuring out what my models should look like today and after that&rsquo;s done I&rsquo;ll see what follows.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why I&rsquo;m writing this is because it is actually pretty decent motivation for me to keep going but also because I feel like this
would be very interesting for anyone trying to start a new project to read through once I&rsquo;m finished.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s about it for now so see you all in part 1 hopefully soon.</p>

      <description>Tests and automated coverage reports with .NET and Github actions</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Most Web API templates I could find online do not have testing pre configured in them and the official ones do not have it at all so I thought
that I would make a post about setting up basic unit tests as well as mocking dependencies.</p>
<p>I will be using <a href="https://xunit.net/">XUnit</a> which is one of the most used testing frameworks for .NET as well as
<a href="https://fakeiteasy.github.io/">FakeItEasy</a> for mocking. In the end I will also use <a href="https://dotnetfoundation.org/projects/coverlet">Coverlet</a>
and <a href="https://about.codecov.io/">Codecov</a> for coverage reports.</p>
<p>The API will be the weather forecast template with the addition of a service layer which is what we will be testing. Let&rsquo;s get started!</p>
<h1 id="coding">Coding</h1>
<h2 id="creating-the-project">Creating the project</h2>
<p>I will be creating a solution with 2 projects, one being the API and the other one being the one for testing.</p>
<p>We start by creating a folder for the solution:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mkdir TestingAPI
cd TestingAPI
dotnet new sln
</code></pre></div><p>We can now create the API project and add it to our solution:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">dotnet new webapi -n src
dotnet sln add src/src.csproj
</code></pre></div><p>Similarly for our test project:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">dotnet new xunit -n test
dotnet sln add test/test.csproj
</code></pre></div><p>Running <code>dotnet run --project src</code> should spin up the server and sure enough, visiting <code>https://localhost:5001/weatherforecast</code>
returns us the expected responce.</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-service">Creating the service</h2>
<p>I will create a <code>Services</code> folder and inside it add 2 files: a service interface and its implementation</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-cs" data-lang="cs"><span style="color:#75715e">// IMyDependency.cs
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#66d9ef">using</span> System.Threading.Tasks;

<span style="color:#66d9ef">namespace</span> src.Services
{
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">interface</span> IMyDependency
    {
        Task&lt;<span style="color:#66d9ef">string</span>&gt; GetDataFromDatabaseAsync();
    }
}
</code></pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-cs" data-lang="cs"><span style="color:#75715e">// MyDependency.cs
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#66d9ef">using</span> System.Threading.Tasks;

<span style="color:#66d9ef">namespace</span> src.Services
{
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">MyDependency</span>: IMyDependency
    {
        <span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> Task&lt;<span style="color:#66d9ef">string</span>&gt; GetDataFromDatabaseAsync()
        {
            <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> Task.FromResult(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello From MyDependency!&#34;</span>);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Let&rsquo;s head to our controller and make use of the service we just created there so we can make sure it works:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-cs" data-lang="cs"><span style="color:#75715e">// WeatherForecastController.cs

        Summary = Summaries[rng.Next(Summaries.Length)]
    })
    .ToArray();
}
</code></pre></div><p>Lastly we head to <code>Startup.cs</code> to register the implementation</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-cs" data-lang="cs"><span style="color:#75715e">// Startup.cs

    <span style="color:#75715e">// ...
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>}
</code></pre></div><p>If we now run the app and hit the endpoint we should see <code>Hello From MyDependency!</code> logged in the console.</p>
<h2 id="writing-our-tests">Writing our tests</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s navigate to our test project and write our first test</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-cs" data-lang="cs"><span style="color:#75715e">// UnitTest1.cs
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#66d9ef">using</span> System.Threading.Tasks;
<span style="color:#66d9ef">using</span> FakeItEasy;
<span style="color:#66d9ef">using</span> src.Services;
<span style="color:#66d9ef">using</span> Xunit;

<span style="color:#66d9ef">namespace</span> test
{
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">UnitTest1</span>
    {
<span style="color:#a6e22e">        [Fact]</span>
        <span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">async</span> Task Test1()
        {
            <span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> myDependency = <span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> MyDependency();
            Assert.Equal(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello From MyDependency!&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#66d9ef">await</span> myDependency.GetDataFromDatabaseAsync());
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Here I changed the return type from <code>void</code> to <code>async Task</code> since the method we want to test is async. Running the test with
<code>dotnet test</code> passes but this is not what we want.</p>
<p>In a normal project this method could require a database connection that we probably do not want to make use of in our tests for various reasons.
This is where mocking comes into play; we can provide a fake implementation to our service methods. It might not be as apparent here why this could
be useful so let me explain.</p>
<p>Usually the way I like to structure my apps is to split them into 3 layers</p>
<ul>
<li>Controllers: handle http requests, call service layer</li>
<li>Services: business logic, call repository layer</li>
<li>Repositories: Handle database queries</li>
</ul>
<p>Coming from a Spring Boot background, my terminology might be a bit different than what is normally used for .NET projects but the idea is the same;
split your logic into layers and use dependency injection to interact between them.</p>
<p>The most important layer to test is the service layer since that&rsquo;s where all the actual &ldquo;programming&rdquo; is. In order to test that I would have to mock
my repository interface and have it return arbitrary fake data without actually using the database. You can imagine how bad of an idea it would be
if someone was to test creations, updates or deletions while using the actual database&hellip;</p>
<p>There are some other options such as using a different, in memory database for testing but we will not be covering that in this post.</p>
<p>So back to our test, how do we mock the dependency?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-cs" data-lang="cs"><span style="color:#75715e">// UnitTest1.cs

        }

        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Using the <code>FakeItEasy</code> package we define an instance of the <code>IMyDependency</code> interface using <code>A.Fake</code>. This right now does nothing;
we have to explicitly define what happens when one of the interface methods gets called, we do that with <code>A.CallTo</code>  which accepts a lambda
of the method in question. I am using <code>Task.FromResult</code> because the method is async. If we run the test we can see that it passes which means that
we successfully changed the &ldquo;implementation&rdquo; of our dependency. Again, this is what would normally be a repository and a database call changed to
hard coded data, similar to what would be returned from said database call.</p>
<h2 id="adding-a-ci-pipeline-with-codecov">Adding a CI pipeline with Codecov</h2>
<p>Another thing we could do is add Codecov to get a detailed view of our test coverage. The best way to do that in my
opinion is to create a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline on Github that will generate and push code coverage information everytime we update
the repository.</p>
<p>First go to Codecov&rsquo;s website and create an account. Get your <code>CODECOV_TOKEN</code> and create a repository secret with its value on your github
repository, we will be using this later when we push our data to Codecov.</p>
<p>We also need to create a <code>codecov.yml</code> file with some basic configuration. Here&rsquo;s what I had from a previous project:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml"><span style="color:#75715e"># codecov.yml</span>

<p>Let&rsquo;s create the <code>.github/workflows/dotnet.yml</code> file and use the Github Actions template for .NET apps which includes building and testing.
We only have to add one more step for codecov to work:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>The <a href="https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action">Codecov action</a> offers a few useful parameters for you to use so if you are interested,
read their docs!</p>
<p>With all this done and pushed you just want to wait for the Action to complete. After that&rsquo;s done I can take a look at my coverage</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/codecov.png#center" alt="codecov"  />
</p>
<p>This is very useful to look at when dealing when <em>more than one directory unlike here</em>.</p>
<p>You can also take a look at the exact spots in your code that you tested/missed</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/code.png#center" alt="code"  />
</p>
<p>And finally (but certainly most importantly), codecov gives you a badge to display on your Github repo to show everyone how well tested your code
is. What&rsquo;s the point of testing if you don&rsquo;t let everyone know you did after all?</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Testing is basically essential to any application that is not yet another personal project doomed to be abandoned a few weeks after its inception.
If you decide to test your project I do not see why you wouldn&rsquo;t include coverage reports, whether automated or not. Codecov (and other similar tools)
allow you to set a lot of rules that would fail your pipeline if not met such as: minimum coverage, a minimum threshold of allowed coverage drop on new
commits and a lot more.</p>

      <title>C# and the ELK stack</title>

      <description>Integrating the ELK stack with C#</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="what-is-the-elk-stack">What is the ELK stack?</h1>
<p>With today&rsquo;s applications growing in complexity rapidly, debugging and efficiently digesting logs have become crucial.
That is the problem that the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack">ELK stack</a> is trying to solve.</p>
<p>The ELK stack consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elasticsearch: A distributed search engine with highly refined analytics capabilities</li>
<li>Logstash: A data-processing pipeline that collects data and delivers it to Elasticsearch</li>
<li>Kibana: A visualization platform built expressly for Elasticsearch</li>
</ul>
<p>These three together make for a great way of digesting aggregated logs from your application through visualisations.</p>
<h1 id="what-will-we-be-creating">What will we be creating?</h1>
<p>We will be making a simple API (the default weather forecast template), have it produce logs using Serilog into elasticsearch and viewing them
through kibana.</p>
<p>For this post I will be assuming you have used C# before and thus you have a ready-to-go set up on your machine.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-middleware">Setting up middleware</h2>
<p>I will be setting up middleware to handle logging as it is a cleaner solution than logging in each request. You can read more about middleware
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/write?view=aspnetcore-5.0">here</a>.</p>
<p>I created the following file:</p>

<ul>
<li>It seems that at the time of writing this, version 3 does not support resource limits without using swarm hence the downgrade to 2.4
(please use resource limits if you want your computer to be usable)</li>
<li>The <code>cluster.initial_master_nodes</code> and <code>node.name</code> must have the same value as I want to use a one node cluster</li>
<li>The <code>ELASTICSEARCH_URL</code> and <code>ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS</code> params are needed since by default these will try to find the elasticsearch server at
<code>http://localhost:9200</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-up-serilog">Setting up Serilog</h2>
<p>We will be using the <code>Serilog.AspNetCore</code> (for logging), <code>Serilog.Sinks.Elasticsearch</code> (for pushing our logs to elastic) and
<code>Serilog.Enricher.Environment</code> (for adding properties from System.Environment) packages.</p>
<p>Once you have those installed, go to the <code>appsettings.json</code> file, remove the Logging section and add the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Serilog&#34;</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">:</span> {

}
</code></pre></div><p>Most of this you can find online but for as a short explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li>We enrich our logs with the log context, machine name and the environment (dev/prod)</li>
<li>We push our logs both to the console and to elastic</li>
<li>The logs in elastic will have the format <code>appname-dev/prod_date</code>. Something to keep in mind for this is that it looks like some characters
like <code>:</code> do not work in these patterns or at least didn&rsquo;t work for me hence the underscore.</li>
</ul>
<p>What&rsquo;s cool about this is that we do not have to change our existing logger related code! We can also however use Serilog directly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the <code>using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;</code> import to <code>using Serilog;</code></li>
<li>Remove the generic from the <code>ILogger</code>s</li>
<li>Change <code>_logger.LogError</code> to <code>_logger.Error</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Another thing we can do is edit the Exception data and log some debugging critical parameter.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>If we now run the app logs will start getting pushed to elastic (make sure to also make a few requests so you get some errors!).</p>
<h2 id="kibana">Kibana</h2>
<p>We can now visit <code>http://localhost:5601</code> to access kibana.</p>
<p>Once there, go to <code>Spaces &gt; Manage Spaces</code> from the top right and select default. On the left you should see <code>Index patterns</code> and if you go there
you can essentially define the log pattern that you want kibana to consider, in my case that is <code>elk-development_*</code>. We can then go to
<code>Analytics &gt; Discover</code> and voilà!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/logs.jpg#center" alt="logs"  />
</p>
<p>If you made the Exception data change mentioned earlier you should be able to see that as well</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/data.jpg#center" alt="data"  />
</p>
<p>The true power of this comes from how you can query your logs. You could for example query for <code>level: Error</code> to get all your error logs</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/errors.jpg#center" alt="logs"  />
</p>
<p>You could also make queries like <code>fields.ElapsedMilliseconds &gt; 10</code> or <code>fields.RequestPath: /weatherforecast</code>, you can read more about the
possible queries <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/kuery-query.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>One thing I always love spending way too much time on is visualizations and I can definitely see this being the most powerful feature in
Kibana</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/plots.jpg#center" alt="plots"  />
</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Overall I think this was a pretty cool learning experience for me as I had never done proper error handling or used middleware before in
C# (or used docker hardware limits but we do not talk about that). I think that although I definitely see the ELK stack being invaluable
to a big company, I feel like I will not be using or recommend others to use if for small or personal projects as it is relatively hard
to set up locally and expensive to host (especially if before this you just had a single app instance running).</p>
<p>Long story short; it is definitely pretty cool but like normal logging should be enough for the majority of cases 👍.</p>
<p>And of course by no means will implementing all of this compensate for bad error handling.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>From the plot above we can see that although movies greatly outnumber TV Shows
as of now, they have drastically slowed down their increase and even started
decreasing by 2020 unlike TV Shows that are still growing exponentially in the
last 5 years. It is worth noting that this dataset was mined before the end of
2020 which means that the values from that year may be underrepresented. Despite
that however, the above observation still holds as we can very clearly see a
steady decline in the addition of new movies that begins at 2018.</p>

<p>Here we can see the rate of change more clearly.</p>
<h2 id="wrangle">Wrangle</h2>
<p>I noticed that the <code>duration</code> was a text field instead of a numerical one so I
decided to split that to 2 fields; <code>duration</code> and <code>duration_unit</code> so as to be
able to make some plots on it. I also converted the <code>date_added</code> variable
from a string to the year it’s referring to for the same reason. I also created
a new variable <code>duration_hours</code> which is <code>duration</code> divided by 60, this only
makes sense for Movies of course. Lastly I dropped any entries with Null columns.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Let’s make some more plots!</p>
<h3 id="movie-duration-over-the-years">Movie Duration over the Years</h3>
<p><img src="https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/Blog/posts/tidy_tuesday/netflix_titles/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I think this showcases the shift in the duration of movies over the years very
nicely; we can see that movies that are under an hour only got released almost
exclusively after the year 2000. The more “standard” movie duration of 2-3 hours
is similar but we can see that it started picking up traction a bit before 1-hour
movies. Lastly we can see that really long movies (3 hours or 4 especially) were
a lot more common before the 2000s. If we also account for the fact that more
movies were produced after the 2000s (from this data set) we could say that
long movies have been in decline in recent years.</p>
<p>Another great way to show the decline in duration is this plot which tells the
same story and also shows the few outliars from recent years.</p>

<p>We see that there is a statistically significant difference between the average
release year for movies that have a 3+ hour duration and shorter duration movies.
Take this with a grain of salt however as the population difference between the
short and long movies is very big (600 vs 11000). I will revisit this at the end
of this post and try to model it using a few machine learning algorithms.</p>

<p>Another potentially interesting metric we could explore is the median amount of
years passed between the production and upload to netflix for both Movies and
TV Shows. In the graph I took the 5 longest and 5 shortest pieces of media
when it comes to that “upload time”. We can see that in TV Shows take up all the
5 spots for lowest upload times. That could be attributed to a general drop in
upload time and that along with the fact that TV shows started appearing mostly
recently could explain this.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I want to shift the interest over to the ratings for a bit which I also found
interesting.</p>

<h2 id="modelling">Modelling</h2>
<p>After some trial and error, I decided to try and model the <code>duration</code> using
<code>release_year</code> and <code>listed_in</code>. I changed <code>release_year</code> to start from
the smallest year in the dataset and I applied one hot encoding to <code>listed_in</code>.
Since there are way less movies under 3 hours, I want my model
to be able to pick up almost all of them; I want to keep false negatives
as low as possible so as to make the model more sensitive. The model yields
92% accuracy with only 2 false negatives! Seems like our intuition about
the release year along with the categories a movie is listed in is a very decent
predictor of its duration. I tried modeling with Logistic Regression,
K Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest. I used 10 fold cross validation and
hyper parameter tuning in the last two to increase the performance. I found
random forests to be the most accurate. I decided to hide the code for this
as it is quite lengthy but if you are interested you can always check the source
file <a href="">here</a>.</p>
