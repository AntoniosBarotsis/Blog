\nFrom the plot above we can see that although movies greatly outnumber TV Shows as of now, they have drastically slown down their increase and even started decreasing by 2020 unlike TV Shows that are still growing exponentially in the last 5 years. It is worth noting that this dataset was mined before the end of 2020 which means that the values from that year may be underrepresented. Despite that however, the above observation still holds as we can very clearly see a steady decline in the addition of new movies that begins at 2018.\n\n

\nHere we can see the rate of change more clearly.\n Wrangle I noticed that the duration was a text field instead of a numerical one so I decided to split that to 2 fields; duration and duration_unit so as to be able to make some plots on it. I also converted the date_added variable from a string to the year it’s referring to for the same reason. I also created a new variable duration_hours which is duration divided by 60, this only makes sense for Movies of course. Lastly I dropped any entries with Null columns.\n\nLet’s make some more plots!\nMovie Duration over the Years \nI think this showcases the shift in the duration of movies over the years very nicely; we can see that movies that are under an hour only got released almost exclusively after the year 2000. The more “standard” movie duration of 2-3 hours is similar but we can see that it started picking up traction a bit before 1-hour movies. Lastly we can see that really long movies (3 hours or 4 especially) were a lot more common before the 2000s. If we also account for the fact that more movies were produced after the 2000s (from this data set) we could say that long movies have been in decline in recent years.\nAnother great way to show the

significant difference between the average release year for movies that have a 3+ hour duration and shorter duration movies. Take this with a grain of salt however as the population difference between the short and long movies is very big (600 vs 11000).

\nAnother potentially interesting metric we could explore is the median amount of years passed between the production and upload to netflix for both Movies and TV Shows. In the graph I took the 5 longest and 5 shortest pieces of media when it comes to that “upload time”. We can see that in TV Shows take up all the 5 spots for lowest upload times. That could be attributed to a general drop in upload time and that along with the fact that TV shows started appearing mostly recently could explain this.\n\nI want to shift the interest over to the

\nWe can see the same information plotted differently here.\n  Modelling After some trial and error, I decided to try and model the duration using release_year and listed_in. I changed release_year to start from the smallest year in the dataset and I applied one hot encoding listed_in to Since there are way less movies under 3 hours, I want my model to be able to pick up almost all of them; I want to keep false negatives as low as possible so as to make the model more sensitive. The model yields 92% accuracy with only 2 false negatives! Seems like our intuition about the release year along with the categories a movie is listed in is a very decent predictor of its duration. I tried modeling with Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest. I used 10 fold cross validation and hyper parameter tuning in the last two to increase the performance. I found random forests to be the most accurate. I decided to hide the code for this as it is quite lengthy but if you are interested you can always check the source file here.\n ","wordCount":"4196","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-08-01T20:10:48+02:00","dateModified":"2021-08-01T20:10:48+02:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Antonios Barotsis"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/Blog/posts/tidytuesday/netflix_titles/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"My Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/Blog/favicon.ico"}}}</script>

release date, rating, duration, genre and more. I want to mainly explore how
both Movies and TV Shows changed over time in relation to different parameters.</p>

<p>From the plot above we can see that although movies greatly outnumber TV Shows
as of now, they have drastically slown down their increase and even started
decreasing by 2020 unlike TV Shows that are still growing exponentially in the
last 5 years. It is worth noting that this dataset was mined before the end of
2020 which means that the values from that year may be underrepresented. Despite
that however, the above observation still holds as we can very clearly see a
steady decline in the addition of new movies that begins at 2018.</p>

<div id=wrangle class="section level2">
<h2>Wrangle</h2>
<p>I noticed that the <code>duration</code> was a text field instead of a numerical one so I
decided to split that to 2 fields; <code>duration</code> and <code>duration_unit</code> so as to be
able to make some plots on it. I also converted the <code>date_added</code> variable
from a string to the year it’s referring to for the same reason. I also created
a new variable <code>duration_hours</code> which is <code>duration</code> divided by 60, this only
makes sense for Movies of course. Lastly I dropped any entries with Null columns.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Let’s make some more plots!</p>

<h3>Movie Duration over the Years</h3>
<p><img src=/Blog/posts/TidyTuesday/netflix_titles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png width=100%></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I think this showcases the shift in the duration of movies over the years very
nicely; we can see that movies that are under an hour only got released almost
exclusively after the year 2000. The more “standard” movie duration of 2-3 hours
is similar but we can see that it started picking up traction a bit before 1-hour
movies. Lastly we can see that really long movies (3 hours or 4 especially) were
a lot more common before the 2000s. If we also account for the fact that more
movies were produced after the 2000s (from this data set) we could say that
long movies have been in decline in recent years.</p>
<p>Another great way to show the decline in duration is this plot which tells the
same story and also shows the few outliars from recent years.</p>

<p>We can actually test this hypothesis with a T Test.</p>
<pre class=r><code>ttest_data &lt;- netflix_wrangled %&gt;% 
  filter(type == &quot;Movie&quot;) %&gt;% 
  mutate(is_short = factor(ifelse(duration_hours &lt; 3, TRUE, FALSE))) %&gt;%
  select(release_year, is_short)

t.test(
    release_year ~ is_short,
    data = ttest_data,
    conf.level = 0.95
)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  release_year by is_short
## t = -18.712, df = 695.07, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group FALSE and group TRUE is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -12.061531  -9.770746
## sample estimates:
## mean in group FALSE  mean in group TRUE 
##            2001.830            2012.746</code></pre>
<p>We see that there is a statistically significant difference between the average
release year for movies that have a 3+ hour duration and shorter duration movies.
Take this with a grain of salt however as the population difference between the
short and long movies is very big (600 vs 11000). I will revisit this at the end
of this post and try to model it using a few machine learning algorithms.</p>

<p>Another potentially interesting metric we could explore is the median amount of
years passed between the production and upload to netflix for both Movies and
TV Shows. In the graph I took the 5 longest and 5 shortest pieces of media
when it comes to that “upload time”. We can see that in TV Shows take up all the
5 spots for lowest upload times. That could be attributed to a general drop in
upload time and that along with the fact that TV shows started appearing mostly
recently could explain this.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I want to shift the interest over to the ratings for a bit which I also found
interesting.</p>

<h2>Modelling</h2>
<p>After some trial and error, I decided to try and model the <code>duration</code> using
<code>release_year</code> and <code>listed_in</code>. I changed <code>release_year</code> to start from
the smallest year in the dataset and I applied one hot encoding <code>listed_in</code> to
Since there are way less movies under 3 hours, I want my model
to be able to pick up almost all of them; I want to keep false negatives
as low as possible so as to make the model more sensitive. The model yields
92% accuracy with only 2 false negatives! Seems like our intuition about
the release year along with the categories a movie is listed in is a very decent
predictor of its duration. I tried modeling with Logistic Regression,
K Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest. I used 10 fold cross validation and
hyper parameter tuning in the last two to increase the performance. I found
random forests to be the most accurate. I decided to hide the code for this
as it is quite lengthy but if you are interested you can always check the source
file <a href>here</a>.</p>
